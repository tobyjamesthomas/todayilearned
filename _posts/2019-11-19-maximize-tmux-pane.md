TIL, you can toggle to maximize / minimize a tmux pane with `prefix + z`, which for me is `Ctrl-b + z`. This lets you zoom into the current pane temporarily.

{% include image.html path="posts/maximize-tmux-pane/zoom.gif" path-detail="posts/maximize-tmux-pane/zoom.gif" caption="Zoom zoom" alt="Zoom zoom" %}
