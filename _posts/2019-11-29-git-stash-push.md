TIL, you can stash individual files in a working directory with `git stash push`, followed by the paths of the files you want to stash.

For example, `git stash push supe.rb pup.py` will only stash `supe.rb` and `pup.py`, which can then be retrieved using `git stash pop` or `git stash apply`.

In practice, when working on a feature, I can use `git stash push app/ui` to stash frontend changes, to separate frontend and backend commits.
